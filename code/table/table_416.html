(A)to have taxes withheld in excess of the minimum amount required to be withheld by the Company under applicable law; provided that the Grantee certifies in writing to the Company at the time of such election that the Grantee owns Other

of the taxes to be withheld in connection with such grant, Vesting Date or Account distribution. In all cases, the Shares so withheld by the Company shall have a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the amount of taxes to be withheld minus the
cash payment, if any, made by the Grantee or withheld from an Account distribution. Any election pursuant to this Paragraph 9(c)(ii) must be in writing made prior to the date specified by the Committee, and in any event prior to the date the amount
of tax to be withheld or paid is determined. An election pursuant to this Paragraph9(c)(ii) may be made only by a Grantee or, in the event of the Grantees death, by the Grantees legal representative. Shares withheld pursuant to
this Paragraph9(c)(ii) shall be available for subsequent grants under the Plan. The Committee may add such other requirements and limitations regarding elections pursuant to this Paragraph9(c)(ii) as it deems appropriate.
