market or in private transactions subject to market conditions. As of December31, 2008, we had approximately $4.1 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We have previously indicated our plan to fully use
our remaining share repurchase authorization by the end of 2009, subject to market conditions. However, it is unlikely that we will complete our share repurchase authorization by the end of 2009 as previously planned. </font></p></td></tr></table>
