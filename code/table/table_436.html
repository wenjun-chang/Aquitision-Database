<td align="left" valign="top"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">In July 2006, in connection with certain transactions with Adelphia and Time Warner, we transferred our previously owned cable systems located in Los Angeles, Cleveland and Dallas
to Time Warner Cable. These cable systems are presented as discontinued operations for the years ended on or before December 31, 2006. Accordingly, we have adjusted the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends to reflect
the impact of discontinued operations. Prior to this adjustment, the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 2.01x and 1.97x, respectively. </font></td></tr></table>
