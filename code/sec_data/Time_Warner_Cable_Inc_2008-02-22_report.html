    As described in more detail below, under separate agreements (as
    amended, the TW NY Purchase Agreement and
    Comcast Purchase Agreement, respectively, and,
    collectively, the Purchase Agreements), TW NY and
    Comcast purchased substantially all of the cable assets of
    Adelphia. The Purchase Agreements were entered into after
    Adelphia filed voluntary petitions for relief under
    Chapter11 of Title11 of the United States Bankruptcy
    Code (the Bankruptcy Code). This section provides
    additional details regarding the Purchase Agreements, the
    Adelphia Acquisition and Comcasts acquisition of certain
    of Adelphias assets (the Comcast Adelphia
    acquisition), along with certain other agreements TWC and
    certain of its subsidiaries entered into with Comcast.

<i>The TW NY Purchase Agreement.</i>On
    April20, 2005, TW NY, one of TWCs subsidiaries,
    entered into the TW NY Purchase Agreement with Adelphia. The TW
    NY Purchase Agreement provided that TW NY would purchase certain
    assets and assume certain liabilities from Adelphia. On
    June21, 2006, Adelphia and TW NY entered into Amendment
    No.2 to the TW NY Purchase Agreement (the TW NY
    Amendment). Under the terms of the TW NY Amendment, the
    assets TW NY acquired from Adelphia and the consideration to be
    paid to Adelphia remained unchanged. However, the TW NY
    Amendment provided that the Adelphia acquisition would be
    effected in accordance with the provisions of sections105,
    363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Adelphia Acquisition
    closed on July31, 2006 (the Adelphia Closing),
    immediately after the Redemptions. The Adelphia Acquisition
    included cable systems located in the following areas: West Palm
    Beach, Florida; Cleveland and Akron, Ohio; Los Angeles,
    California; and suburbs of the District of Columbia (some of
    these systems were transferred by TWC to Comcast as part of the
    Exchange). As consideration for the assets purchased from
    Adelphia, TW NY assumed certain liabilities as specified in the
    TW NY Purchase Agreement, paid to Adelphia approximately
    $8.9billion in cash, after giving effect to certain
    purchase price adjustments discussed below, and delivered
    149,765,147shares of TWC ClassA common stock to
    Adelphia. This represented approximately 17.3% of TWC
    ClassA common stock outstanding (including shares issued
    into escrow), and approximately 16% of TWCs total
    outstanding common stock as of the closing of the Adelphia
    Acquisition.

    Approximately 6million shares of TWC ClassA common
    stock and approximately $360million in cash were deposited
    into escrow to secure Adelphias obligations in respect of
    any post-closing adjustments to the purchase price and its
    indemnification obligations for, among other things, breaches of
    its representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
    TW NY Purchase Agreement. All of the shares and substantially
    all of the cash have been released from escrow except for an
    amount of cash retained to satisfy claims against the escrow
    asserted on or prior to July31, 2007.

    The TW NY Purchase Agreement required TWC, at the Adelphia
    Closing, to amend and restate its By-laws to restrict TWC and
    its subsidiaries from entering into transactions with or for the
    benefit of Time Warner and its affiliates other than TWC and its
    subsidiaries (the Time Warner Group), subject to
    specified exceptions. Additionally, prior to August1, 2011
    (five years following the Adelphia Closing), TWCs restated
    certificate of incorporation and By-laws do not allow for an
    amendment to the provisions of its By-laws restricting these
    transactions without the consent of a majority of the holders of
    TWC ClassA common stock, other than any member of the Time
    Warner Group. Additionally, under the TW NY Purchase Agreement,
    TWC agreed that it will not enter into any short-form merger
    prior to August1, 2008 (two years after the Adelphia
    Closing).

<i>Parent Agreement.</i>Pursuant to the Parent
    Agreement among Adelphia, TW NY and TWC, dated as of
    April20, 2005, TWC, among other things, guaranteed the
    obligations of TW NY to Adelphia under the TW NY Purchase
    Agreement.

<i>The Comcast Purchase Agreement.</i>The Comcast
    Purchase Agreement had similar terms to the TW NY Purchase
    Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Comcast
    Purchase Agreement also closed on July31, 2006. The
    Comcast Adelphia acquisition was effected in accordance with the
    provisions of sections105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy
    Code and a plan of reorganization for the joint ventures
    referred to in the following sentence. The Comcast Adelphia
    acquisition included cable systems and Adelphias interest
    in two joint ventures in which Comcast also held interests:
    Century-TCI California Communications, L.P. (the
    Century-TCI joint venture), which owned cable
    systems in the Los Angeles, California area, and Parnassos
    Communications, L.P. (the Parnassos joint venture),
    which owned cable systems in Ohio and Western New York. The
    purchase price under the Comcast Purchase Agreement was
    approximately $3.6billion in cash.

    As described in more detail below, on the same day as the
    parties consummated the transactions governed by the Purchase
    Agreements, TWC and some of its affiliates (collectively, the
    TWC Group) and Comcast consummated the TWC
    Redemption, the TWE Redemption and the Exchange (collectively,
    the TWC/Comcast Transactions). Under the terms of
    the agreement which governed the TWC Redemption (the TWC
    RedemptionAgreement), TWC redeemed Comcasts
    investment in TWC in exchange for one of TWCs subsidiaries
    that held both cable systems and cash. In accordance with the
    terms of the agreement which governed the TWE Redemption (the
    TWE RedemptionAgreement), TWE redeemed
    Comcasts interest in TWE in exchange for one of TWEs
    subsidiaries that held both cable systems and cash. In
    accordance with the terms of the agreement which governed the
    Exchange (as amended, the Exchange Agreement), TW NY
    and Comcast transferred to one another subsidiaries that held
    certain cable systems, including cable systems acquired by each
    from Adelphia. The TWC RedemptionAgreement, the TWE
    RedemptionAgreement and the Exchange Agreement, are
    collectively referred to as the TWC/Comcast
    Agreements.

<i>The TWC RedemptionAgreement.</i>Pursuant to
    the TWC RedemptionAgreement, dated as of April20,
    2005, as amended, among TWC and certain other members of the TWC
    Group and Comcast, the TWC Redemption was effected and
    Comcasts interest in TWC was redeemed on July31,
    2006, immediately prior to the Adelphia Acquisition. The TWC
    RedemptionAgreement required that TWC redeem all of the
    TWC ClassA common stock held by TWE HoldingsII Trust
    (Comcast TrustII), a trust that was
    established for the benefit of Comcast, in exchange for 100% of
    the common stock of Cable HoldcoII Inc. (Cable
    HoldcoII), then a subsidiary of TWC. At the time of
    the TWC Redemption, Cable HoldcoII held both certain cable
    systems previously owned directly or indirectly by TWC
    (TWC RedemptionSystems) serving approximately
    589,000 basic subscribers and approximately $1.9billion in
    cash, subject generally to the liabilities associated with the
    TWC RedemptionSystems. Certain specified assets and
    liabilities of the TWC RedemptionSystems were retained by
    TWC.

    As discussed further in Note4 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements, on July31, 2006,
    TWNY and Comcast completed their respective acquisitions
    of assets comprising in the aggregate substantially all of the
    cable assets of Adelphia (the Adelphia Acquisition).
    Additionally, on July31, 2006, immediately before the
    closing of the Adelphia Acquisition, Comcasts interests in
    TWC and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P.
    (TWE), a subsidiary of TWC, were redeemed (the
    TWC Redemption and the TWE Redemption,
    respectively, and, collectively, the Redemptions).
    Following the Redemptions and the Adelphia Acquisition, on
    July31, 2006, TW NY and Comcast swapped certain cable
    systems, most of which were acquired from Adelphia, in order to
    enhance TWCs and Comcasts respective geographic
    clusters of subscribers (the Exchange and, together
    with the Adelphia Acquisition and the Redemptions, the
    Transactions). As a result of the closing of the
    Transactions, on July31, 2006, TWC acquired systems with
    approximately 4.0million basic video subscribers and
    disposed of the Transferred Systems (as defined below), with
    approximately 0.8million basic video subscribers, for a
    net gain of approximately 3.2million basic video
    subscribers. In addition, on July28, 2006, American
    Television and Communications Corporation (ATC), a
    subsidiary of Time Warner, contributed its 1% common equity
    interest and $2.4billion preferred equity interest in TWE
    to TW NY Cable Holding Inc. (TWNY Holding), a
    subsidiary of TWC and the parent of TW NY, in exchange for a
    12.43% non-voting common stock interest in TWNY Holding
    (the ATC Contribution).

    The results of the systems acquired in connection with the
    Transactions have been included in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations since the closing of the Transactions.
    The systems previously owned by TWC that were transferred to

    On February13, 2007, Adelphias Chapter11
    reorganization plan became effective and, under applicable
    securities law regulations and provisions of the
    U.S.bankruptcy code, TWC became a public company subject
    to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the Exchange Act). Under the terms of the
    reorganization plan, during 2007, substantially all of the
    155,913,430shares of TWCs ClassA common stock
    that Adelphia received in the Adelphia Acquisition (representing
    approximately 16% of TWCs outstanding common stock) were
    distributed to Adelphias creditors. The remaining shares
    are expected to be distributed as the remaining disputes are
    resolved by the bankruptcy court. As of December31, 2007,
    Time Warner owned approximately 84.0% of TWCs outstanding
    common stock (including 82.7% of the outstanding shares of
    TWCs ClassA common stock and all outstanding shares
    of TWCs ClassB common stock, representing a 90.6%
    voting interest), as well as a 12.43% non-voting common stock
    interest in TW NY Holding. On March1, 2007, TWCs
    ClassA common stock began trading on the New York Stock
    Exchange under the symbol TWC (Note4).

    In the normal course of business, TWC enters into
    multiple-element transactions where the Company is
    simultaneously both a customer and a vendor with the same
    counterparty. For example, when negotiating the terms of
    programming purchase contracts with cable networks, TWC may at
    the same time negotiate for the sale of advertising to the same
    cable network. Arrangements, although negotiated
    contemporaneously, may be documented in one or more contracts.
    In accounting for such arrangements, the Company looks to the
    guidance contained in the following authoritative literature:

    In the normal course of business, TWC enters into
    multiple-element transactions where the Company is
    simultaneously both a customer and a vendor with the same
    counterparty. For example, when negotiating the terms of
    programming purchase contracts with cable networks, TWC may at
    the same time negotiate for the sale of advertising to the same
    cable network. Arrangements, although negotiated
    contemporaneously, may be documented in one or more contracts.
    In accounting for such arrangements, the Company looks to the
    guidance contained in the following authoritative literature:

    On July31, 2006, TW NY and Comcast completed their
    respective acquisitions of assets comprising in the aggregate
    substantially all of the cable assets of Adelphia (the
    Adelphia Acquisition). At the closing of the
    Adelphia Acquisition, TW NY paid approximately $8.9billion
    in cash, after giving effect to certain purchase price
    adjustments, and shares representing 17.3% of TWCs
    ClassA common stock (approximately 16% of TWCs
    outstanding common stock) valued at approximately
    $5.5billion for the portion of the Adelphia assets it
    acquired. The valuation of approximately $5.5billion for
    the approximately 16% interest in TWC as of July31, 2006
    was determined by management using a DCF and market comparable
    valuation model. The DCF valuation model was based upon the
    Companys estimated future cash flows derived from its
    business plan and utilized a discount rate consistent with the
    inherent risk in the business. The 16% interest reflects
    155,913,430shares of TWC ClassA common stock issued
    to Adelphia, which were valued at $35.28 per share for purposes
    of the Adelphia Acquisition.

    In addition, on July28, 2006, American Television and
    Communications Corporation (ATC), a subsidiary of
    Time Warner, contributed its 1% common equity interest and
    $2.4billion preferred equity interest in Time Warner
    Entertainment Company, L.P. (TWE) to TW NY Cable
    Holding Inc. (TW NY Holding), a newly created
    subsidiary of TWC and the parent of TW NY, in exchange for a
    12.43% non-voting common stock interest in TW NY Holding having
    an equivalent fair value.

    On July31, 2006, immediately before the closing of the
    Adelphia Acquisition, Comcasts interests in TWC and TWE
    were redeemed. Specifically, Comcasts 17.9% interest in
    TWC was redeemed in exchange for 100% of the capital stock of a
    subsidiary of TWC holding both cable systems serving 589,000
    basic video subscribers, with an estimated fair value of
    $2.470billion, as determined by management using a DCF and

    valuation model, and $1.857billion in cash (the TWC
    Redemption). In addition, Comcasts 4.7% interest in
    TWE was redeemed in exchange for 100% of the equity interests of
    a subsidiary of TWE holding both cable systems serving 162,000
    basic video subscribers, with an estimated fair value of
    $630million, as determined by management using a DCF and
    market comparable valuation model, and $147million in cash
    (the TWE Redemption and, together with the TWC
    Redemption, the Redemptions). The DCF valuation
    model was based upon the Companys estimated future cash
    flows derived from its business plan and utilized a discount
    rate consistent with the inherent risk in the business. The TWC
    Redemption was designed to qualify as a tax-free split-off under
    section355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Tax Code). For accounting purposes, the
    Redemptions were treated as an acquisition of Comcasts
    minority interests in TWC and TWE and a disposition of the cable
    systems that were transferred to Comcast. As of
    December31, 2006, the purchase of the minority interests
    resulted in a reduction of goodwill of $738million related
    to the excess of the carrying value of the Comcast minority
    interests over the total fair value of the Redemptions. In
    addition, the disposition of the cable systems resulted in an
    after-tax gain of $945million included in discontinued
    operations for the year ended December31, 2006, which is
    comprised of a $131million pretax gain (calculated as the
    difference between the carrying value of the systems acquired by
    Comcast in the Redemptions totaling $2.969billion and the
    estimated fair value of $3.100billion) and a net tax
    benefit of $814million, including the reversal of
    historical deferred tax liabilities of $838million that
    had existed on systems transferred to Comcast in the TWC
    Redemption.

    Following the Redemptions and the Adelphia Acquisition, on
    July31, 2006, TW NY and Comcast swapped certain cable
    systems, most of which were acquired from Adelphia, each with an
    estimated value of $8.700billion, as determined by
    management using a DCF and market comparable valuation model, in
    order to enhance TWCs and Comcasts respective
    geographic clusters of subscribers (the Exchange
    and, together with the Adelphia Acquisition and the Redemptions,
    the Transactions), and TW NY paid Comcast
    $67million for certain adjustments related to the
    Exchange. The DCF valuation model was based upon estimated
    future cash flows and utilized a discount rate consistent with
    the inherent risk in the business. The Exchange was accounted
    for as a purchase of cable systems from Comcast and a sale of TW
    NYs cable systems to Comcast. The systems exchanged by TW
    NY included Urban Cable Works of Philadelphia, L.P. (Urban
    Cable) and systems acquired from Adelphia. The Company did
    not record a gain or loss on systems TW NY acquired from
    Adelphia and transferred to Comcast in the Exchange because such
    systems were recorded at fair value in the Adelphia Acquisition.
    The Company did, however, record a pretax gain of
    $34million ($20million, net of tax) on the Exchange
    related to the disposition of Urban Cable, which is included in
    discontinued operations for the year ended December31,
    2006.
