announced that we re-acquired the Canadian rights for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), including Kuvan, from Merck Serono, a division of Merck KGaA. The terms of the agreement specified a reduction in royalties owed to BioMarin on Merck Serono sales
outside the United States and Japan. Based on the structure of the amended agreement, the reduction in royalties cannot exceed an undisclosed amount. </font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"></font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b><i>FDA Approval for Kuvan </i></b></font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><font size="1"></font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On December13, 2007, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted marketing approval for Kuvan, an orally administered
preparation for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). Kuvan has received orphan drug designation from the FDA, conferring upon it seven years of market exclusivity in the United States, until 2014. We began shipping product to the distribution
channel the day after the announcement of Kuvan approval, and immediately began promotion. Our list sales price for Kuvan is $0.29 per mg. </font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"></font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b><i>Collaboration with IGAN BioSciences on Development of Enzyme Therapy to Treat IGA Nephropathy </i></b></font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><font size="1"></font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">On December3, 2007, we announced a collaboration with IGAN BioSciences
(IGAN) to develop an IgA protease for treating IgA nephropathy or Bergers disease, an orphan kidney disorder with few treatment alternatives. Twenty percent of adults with the disorder progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD). In the U.S.,
approximately 800 patients per year develop ESRD caused by IgA nephropathy out of the 40,000 patients affected by the disorder. </font></p>
