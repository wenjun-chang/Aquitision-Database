<html><body><b><i>Acquisitions</i></b><div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Management believes the Companys business and asset acquisitions in recent years have enhanced the
Companys position as a vertically-integrated industry leader and established a strong foundation
for growth. Although the Companys assets, loan portfolios, and fee-based revenues increase
through such transactions, a key aspect of each transaction is its impact on the Companys
prospective organic growth and the development of its integrated platform of services. Management
believes these acquisitions allow the Company to expand the products and services offered to
education and financial institutions and students and families throughout the education and
education finance process. In addition, these acquisitions diversify the Companys asset
generation streams and/or

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">diversify revenue by offering other products and services that are not
dependent on government programs, which reduces the Companys exposure to legislation and political
risk. The Company also expects to reduce costs from these acquisitions through economies of scale
and by integrating certain support services. In addition, the Company expects to increase revenue
from these acquisitions by offering multiple products and services to its customers. As a result
of these recent acquisitions and the Companys rapid organic growth, the period-to-period
comparability of the Companys results of operations may be difficult.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><b><i>Net Interest Income</i></b>
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates a significant portion of its earnings from the spread, referred to as its
student loan spread, between the yield the Company receives on its student loan portfolio and the
cost of funding these loans. This spread income is reported on the Companys consolidated statement
of operations as net interest income. The amortization of loan premiums, including capitalized
costs of origination, the consolidation loan rebate fee, and yield adjustments from borrower
benefit programs, are netted against loan interest income on the Companys statements of income.
The amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense on the Companys statements
of income.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Companys portfolio of FFELP loans originated prior to April1, 2006 earns interest at the
higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment (SAP)formula set by the
Department and the borrower rate. The SAP formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed
spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated, the loans repayment status, and
funding sources for the loan. As a result of one of the provisions of HERA, the Companys
portfolio of FFELP loans originated on or after April1, 2006 earns interest at a variable rate
based on the SAP formula. For the portfolio of loans originated on or after April1, 2006, when
the borrower rate exceeds the variable rate based on the SAP formula, the Company must return the
excess to the Department.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On most consolidation loans, the Company must pay a 1.05% per year rebate fee to the Department.
Those consolidation loans that have variable interest rates based on the SAP formula earn an annual
yield less than that of a Stafford loan. Those consolidation loans that have fixed interest rates
less than the sum of 1.05% and the variable rate based on the SAP formula also earn an annual yield
less than that of a Stafford loan. As a result, as consolidation loans matching these criteria
become a larger portion of the Companys loan portfolio, there will be a lower yield on the
Companys loan portfolio in the short term. However, due to the extended terms of consolidation
loans, the Company expects to earn the yield on these loans for a longer duration, making them
beneficial to the Company in the long term.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because the Company generates a significant portion of its earnings from its student loan spread,
the interest rate sensitivity of the Companys balance sheet is very important to its operations.
The current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the Companys interest
earnings, net interest income, and net income. The effects of changing interest rate environments
are further outlined in Item7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
Interest Rate Risk.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Investment interest income, which is a component of net interest income, includes income from
unrestricted interest-earning deposits and funds in the Companys special purpose entities which
are utilized for its asset-backed securitizations.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><b><i>Provision for Loan Losses</i></b>
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The allowance for loan losses is estimated and established through a provision charged to expense.
Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of the loan
principal is unlikely. Recovery of amounts previously charged off is credited to the allowance for
loan losses. The allowance for federally insured and non-federally insured loans is maintained at
a level management believes is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in
the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may
be susceptible to significant changes. The Company analyzes the allowance separately for its
federally insured loans and its non-federally insured loans.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the
Companys loan portfolios considering past experience, trends in student loan claims rejected for
payment by guarantors, changes to federal student loan programs, current economic conditions, and
other relevant factors. One of the changes to the Higher Education Act as a result of HERAs
enactment in February2006 was to lower the guarantee rates on FFELP loans, including a decrease in
insurance and reinsurance on portfolios receiving the benefit of the Exceptional Performance
designation by 1%, from 100% to 99% of principal and accrued interest (effective July1, 2006), and
a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios not subject to the Exceptional Performance
designation by 1%, from 98% to 97% of principal and accrued interest (effective for all loans first
disbursed on and after July1, 2006). In February2006, as a result of the change in these
legislative provisions, the Company recorded an expense of $6.9million ($4.3million after tax) to
increase the Companys allowance for loan losses.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September2005, the Company was re-designated as an Exceptional Performer by the Department in
recognition of its exceptional level of performance in servicing FFELP loans. As a result of this
designation, the Company receives 99% reimbursement (100% reimbursement prior to July1, 2006) on
all eligible FFELP default claims submitted for reimbursement. Only FFELP loans that are serviced
by the Company, as well as loans owned by the Company and serviced by other service providers
designated as Exceptional Performers by the Department, are eligible for the 99% reimbursement.
As of December31, 2006, more than 99% of the Companys

organization, specifically that of the Companys school-based marketing efforts. The Companys
costs to develop its corporate structure include projects such as recruitment, development, and

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Companys total assets increased $4.0billion, or 17.5%, during 2006 primarily due to an
increase in student loans receivable and related assets. The Company originated or acquired $6.7
billion in student loans which was offset by repayments and loan sales. The Company financed the
increase in student loans and total assets through the issuance of bonds and notes payable. In
addition, in September2006, the Company issued $200.0million of unsecured debt, a portion of
which was used to repurchase 1.9million shares of the Companys ClassA Common Stock for $62.4
million under its existing share repurchase program.

<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><b>OPERATING SEGMENTS</b>
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has five operating segments as defined in SFAS No.131, <i>Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information </i>(SFAS No.131), as follows: Asset Generation and
Management, Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing, Tuition Payment Processing and Campus Commerce,
Enrollment Services and List Management, and Software and Technical Services. The Companys
operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers
they serve, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by
management. During 2006, the Company changed the structure of its internal organization in a
manner that caused the composition of its operating segments to change. All earlier years
presented have been restated to conform to the 2006 operating segment presentation. The accounting
policies of the Companys operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. Intersegment revenues are charged by a segment to another segment
that provides the product or service. The amount of intersegment revenue is based on comparable
fees charged in the market. Intersegment revenues and expenses are included within each segment
consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The management reporting process measures the performance of the Companys operating segments based
on the management structure of the Company as well as the methodology used by management to
evaluate performance and allocate resources. Management, including the Companys chief operating
decision maker, evaluates the performance of the Companys operating segments based on their
profitability. As discussed further below, management measures the profitability of the Companys
operating segments based on base net income. Accordingly, information regarding the Companys
operating segments is provided based on base net income. The Companys base net income is not
a defined term within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for
management reporting.
</div>
<div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Base net income is the primary financial performance measure used by management to develop the
Companys financial plans, track results, and establish corporate performance targets and incentive
compensation. While base net income is not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, the
Company relies on base net income in operating its business because base net income permits
management to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the operational and performance
indicators that are most closely

certain asset acquisitions. Although the Companys assets, loan portfolios, net interest income,
and fee-based revenues increase through such transactions, a key aspect of each transaction is its
impact on the Companys prospective organic growth and the development of its integrated platform
of services. The acquisitions described below expand the Companys products and services offered
to education and financial institutions and students and families throughout the education and
education finance process. In addition, these acquisitions diversify the Companys asset
generation streams and/or diversify revenue by offering other products and services that are not
dependent on government programs, which reduces the Companys exposure to legislation and political
risk. The Company also expects to reduce costs from these acquisitions through economies of scale
and by integrating certain support services. In addition, the Company expects to increase revenue
from these acquisitions by offering multiple products and services to its customers.

Premiere has a put option, which expires five years after the purchase date, to require the
Company to purchase 100% ownership of Premiere at a price as determined in the agreement. The call
and put option prices are based on a formula of future pre-tax net income of Premiere through 2010

is not determinable until these future dates. The Company is accounting for Premiere using the

average useful life of approximately 7years. The intangible assets that made up this amount
included non-competition agreements of $2.0million (5-year useful life), customer relationships of
$1.6million (10-year useful life), computer software of $0.4million (5-year useful life), and
trade names of $0.2million (3-year useful life). All intangible assets are amortized using a
straight-line amortization method with the exception of customer relationships. The customer
relationships intangible asset is amortized over the projected revenues and expenses (cash
flows) attributable to this asset as of the date of acquisition. Because of customer attrition,
the estimated annual cash flows related to customer relationships diminish the further from the
date of acquisition. As such, the Company uses an accelerated amortization method that reflects
the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits of this acquired asset is used by the Company.
