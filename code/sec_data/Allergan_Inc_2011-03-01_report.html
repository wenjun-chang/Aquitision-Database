completed a business combination agreement and effected a revised distribution agreement with our distributor in Turkey.We paid $33.0 million for the termination of the original distribution agreement and purchased the commercial assets
related to the selling of our products in Turkey for $6.1 million in cash and estimated contingent consideration of $36.7 million as of the acquisition date.On January15, 2010, we acquired Serica Technologies, Inc., or Serica, for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $63.7million, net of cash acquired.On July7, 2009, we acquired a 50.001% stockholder interest in a joint venture, Samil Allergan Ophthalmic Joint Venture Company, or Samil, for
approximately $14.8 million, net of cash acquired.We accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations.The tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions were recognized
based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates.The determination of estimated fair values requires significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the
in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates.We believe the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable

October1 each year.</font></p><p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We primarily use the income approach and the market approach to valuation that
include the discounted cash flow method, the guideline company method, as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units.Upon completion of the October 2010 annual impairment
assessment, we determined that no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of the two reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value.As of December31, 2010, we do not believe any significant indicators of
impairment exist for our goodwill that would require additional analysis.</font></p><p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We also review purchased intangible

requires companies to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether a variable interest in another entity represents a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. A controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity
is characterized by having both the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity.This guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of variable
interests based on changes in facts and circumstances.This guidance became effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2009.The Company adopted the provisions of the guidance in the first quarter of 2010 and determined
that as of December31, 2010, the Company holds a variable interest in one variable interest entity (VIE) for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. </font></p><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted </i></b></font></p><p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">In
December 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that provides guidance on the recognition and classification of the annual fee imposed by the Patient Act and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act on pharmaceutical companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drugs.Under this guidance, the annual fee should be estimated and recognized in full as a liability upon the first qualifying sale with a
corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating expense using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year in which it is payable. The annual fee ranges from $2.5 billion to
$4.1 billion for all affected entities in total, a portion of which will be allocated to the Company on the basis of the amount of its branded prescription drug sales for the preceding year as a percentage of the industrys branded prescription
drug sales for the same period. The annual fee is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. This guidance will be effective for calendar years beginning after December31, 2010, which will be the Companys fiscal year 2011. The
Company currently estimates the annual fee for 2011 to be approximately $20.0 million.</font></p><br/><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br/><b>Note2:Acquisitions and Collaborations</b><b> </b><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Purchase of Distributors Business in Turkey </i></b></font></p><p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">On July1, 2010, the Company terminated its existing distributor agreement in Turkey and completed the purchase from
