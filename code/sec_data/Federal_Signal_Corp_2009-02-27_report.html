    On January15, 2007, the Company acquired the net assets of
    Codespear LLC, a Birmingham, Michigan based, privately held
    developer of specialized software used in emergency management
    situations, for $16.6million in cash plus an additional
    $0.8million payment based on working capital and
    contingent consideration adjustments which were finalized in the
    third quarter of 2007. In addition, there are potential
    additional earnout payments for up to three years following the
    transaction, if specific performance targets are met. Any
    additional payments related to this contingency will be
    accounted for as additional goodwill, however, as of
    December31, 2008, the performance targets have not been
    met and no additional payments are due. As a result of the
    acquisition, the Company recorded the addition of
    $12.2million of goodwill in 2007, which was deductible for
    tax purposes, and $5.2million of acquired developed
    software. The results since the date of acquisition are included
    in the Safety and Security Systems segment.
