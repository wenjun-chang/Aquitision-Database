<i>The TW NY Purchase Agreement.</i>On
    April20, 2005, TW NY, one of TWCs subsidiaries,
    entered into the TW NY Purchase Agreement with ACC. The TW NY
    Purchase Agreement provided that TW NY would purchase certain
    assets and assume certain liabilities from Adelphia. On
    June21, 2006, ACC and TW NY entered into Amendment
    No.2 to the TW NY Purchase Agreement (the TW NY
    Amendment). Under the terms of the TW NY Amendment, the
    assets TW NY acquired from Adelphia and the consideration to be
    paid to Adelphia remained unchanged. However, the TW NY
    Amendment provided that the TW NY Adelphia Acquisition would be
    effected in accordance with the provisions of sections105,
    363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and, as a result,
    Adelphias creditors were not required to approve a plan of
    reorganization under chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code
    prior to the consummation of the TW NY Adelphia Acquisition. The
    TW NY Adelphia Acquisition closed on July31, 2006,
    immediately after the Redemptions. The TW NY Adelphia
    Acquisition included cable systems located in the following
    areas: West Palm Beach, Florida; Cleveland and Akron, Ohio; Los
    Angeles, California; and suburbs of the District of Columbia. As
    consideration for the assets purchased from Adelphia, TW NY
    assumed certain liabilities as specified in the TW NY Purchase
    Agreement and paid to ACC approximately $8.9billion in
    cash (including approximately $360million paid into
    escrow), after giving effect to certain purchase price
    adjustments discussed below, and delivered
    149,765,147shares of TWC ClassA common stock to ACC
    and 6,148,283shares of TWC ClassA common stock into
    escrow. This represents approximately 17.3% of the TWC
    ClassA common stock outstanding (including shares issued
    into escrow), and approximately 16% of TWCs total
    outstanding common stock as of the closing of the TW NY Adelphia
    Acquisition.

    The purchase price is subject to customary adjustments to
    reflect changes in Adelphias net liabilities and
    subscribers as well as any shortfall in Adelphias capital
    expenditure spending relative to its budget during the interim
    period (the Interim Period) between the execution of
    the TW NY Purchase Agreement and the closing of the transactions
    contemplated by the TW NY Purchase Agreement (the Adelphia
    Closing). The approximately $360million in cash and
    6million shares of TWC ClassA common stock that were
    deposited into escrow are securing Adelphias obligations
    in respect of any post-closing adjustments to the purchase price
    and its indemnification obligations for, among other things,
    breaches of its representations, warranties and covenants
    contained in the TW NY Purchase Agreement. One-third of the
    escrow, beginning with the cash amounts, was to be released on
    January31, 2007 (six months after the Adelphia Closing)
    with the remaining amounts to be released on July31, 2007
    (12months after the Adelphia Closing), in each case except
    to the extent of amounts paid prior to such date or that would
    be expected to be necessary to satisfy claims asserted on or
    prior to such date. On January31, 2007, the escrow agent
    released to Adelphia approximately $172million in cash,
    representing one-third of the aggregate value of the escrow.

    The parties to the TW NY Purchase Agreement made customary
    representations and warranties. ACCs representations and
    warranties survive for twelve months after the Adelphia Closing
    and, to the extent any claims are made prior to such date, until
    such claims are resolved. The debtors in Adelphias
    bankruptcy proceedings (excluding, except to the extent provided
    in the TW NY Purchase Agreement, the joint ventures described in
    The Comcast Purchase Agreement below),
    are jointly and severally liable for breaches or violations by
    ACC of its representations, warranties and covenants. The
    representations and warranties of TW NY contained in the TW NY
    Purchase Agreement expired at the Adelphia Closing.

    The TW NY Purchase Agreement included customary and certain
    other covenants made by Adelphia and TW NY, including covenants

    On July31, 2006, TW NY and Comcast completed their
    respective acquisitions of assets comprising in the aggregate
    substantially all of the cable assets of Adelphia (the

    Adelphia Acquisition, TW NY paid approximately $8.9billion
    in cash, after giving effect to certain purchase price
    adjustments, and shares representing 17.3% of TWCs
    ClassA common stock (16% of TWCs outstanding common
    stock) for the portion of the Adelphia assets it acquired. In
    addition, on July28, 2006, American Television and

    Time Warner, contributed its 1% common equity interest and
    $2.4billion preferred equity interest in TWE to TW NY

    On February13, 2007, Adelphias plan of
    reorganization under Chapter11 of title11 of the
    United States Code became effective and, under applicable
    securities law regulations and provisions of the
    U.S.bankruptcy code, TWC became a public company subject
    to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on
    the same day. Under the terms of the plan, as of
    February20, 2007, approximately 75% of the shares of TWC
    ClassA common stock that Adelphia received as part of the
    payment for its assets in July 2006 have been distributed to
    Adelphias creditors. The remaining shares are expected to
    be distributed during the coming months as remaining disputes
    are resolved by the bankruptcy court, including 4% of such
    shares that are being held in escrow in connection with the
    Adelphia Acquisition. It is expected that the TWC ClassA
    common stock will begin to trade on the New York Stock Exchange
    on or about March1, 2007.

    At the closing of the Adelphia Acquisition, TWC and Adelphia
    entered into a registration rights and sale agreement (the
    Adelphia Registration Rights and Sale Agreement),
    which governed the disposition of the shares of TWCs
    ClassA common stock received by Adelphia in the Adelphia
    Acquisition. Upon the effectiveness of Adelphias plan of
    reorganization, the parties obligations under the Adelphia
    Registration Rights and Sale Agreement terminated.

    On July31, 2006, immediately before the closing of the
    Adelphia Acquisition, Comcasts interests in TWC and TWE
    were redeemed. Specifically, Comcasts 17.9% interest in
    TWC was redeemed in exchange for 100% of the capital stock of a
    subsidiary of TWC holding both cable systems serving
    approximately 589,000 subscribers and approximately
    $1.857billion in cash (the TWC Redemption). In
    addition, Comcasts 4.7% interest in TWE was redeemed in
    exchange for 100% of the equity interests of a subsidiary of TWE
    holding both cable systems serving approximately 162,000
    subscribers and approximately $147million in cash (the
    TWE Redemption and, together with the TWC
    Redemption, the Redemptions). The TWC Redemption was
    designed to qualify as a tax-free split-off under
    section355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (the Tax Code). For accounting purposes, the
    Redemptions were treated as an acquisition of Comcasts
    minority interests in TWC and TWE and a disposition of the cable
    systems that were transferred to Comcast. The purchase of the
    minority interests resulted in a reduction of goodwill of
    $738million related to the excess of the carrying value of
    the Comcast minority interests over the total fair value of the
    Redemptions. In addition, the disposition of the cable systems
    resulted in an after-tax gain of $945million, included in
    discontinued operations, which is comprised of a
    $131million pretax gain (calculated as the difference
    between the carrying value of the systems acquired by Comcast in
    the Redemptions totaling $2.969billion and the estimated
    fair value of $3.100billion) and a net tax benefit of
    $814million, including the reversal of historical deferred
    tax liabilities of approximately $838million that had
    existed on systems transferred to Comcast in the TWC Redemption.

    Following the Redemptions and the Adelphia Acquisition, on
    July31, 2006, TW NY and Comcast swapped certain cable
    systems, most of which were acquired from Adelphia, in order to
    enhance TWCs and Comcasts respective geographic
    clusters of subscribers (the Exchange and, together
    with the Adelphia Acquisition and the Redemptions, the
    Transactions), and TW NY paid Comcast approximately
    $67million for certain adjustments related to the
    Exchange. The Company did not record a gain or loss on systems
    TW NY acquired from Adelphia and transferred to Comcast in the
    Exchange because such systems were recorded at fair value in the
    Adelphia Acquisition. The Company did, however, record a pretax
    gain of $34million ($20million net of tax) on the
    Exchange related to the disposition of Urban Cable Works of
    Philadelphia, L.P. (Urban Cable). This gain is
    included as a component of discontinued operations in the

    The Adelphia Acquisition was designed to be a taxable
    acquisition of assets that would result in a tax basis in the
    acquired assets equal to the purchase price paid. The
    depreciation and amortization deductions resulting from this
    <font style="white-space: nowrap">step-up</font> in
    the tax basis of the assets would reduce future net cash tax
    payments and thereby increase the Companys future cash
    flows. The Company believes that most cable operators have a tax
    basis that is below the fair market value of their cable systems
    and, accordingly, the Company has viewed a portion of its tax
    basis in the acquired assets as incremental value above the
    amount of basis more generally associated with cable systems.
    The tax benefit of such incremental
    <font style="white-space: nowrap">step-up</font>
    would reduce net cash tax payments by more than
    $300million per year, assuming the following:
    (i)incremental
    <font style="white-space: nowrap">step-up</font>
    relating to 85% of a $14.4billion purchase price (which
    assumes that 15% of the fair market value of cable systems
    represents a typical amount of basis), (ii)straight-line
    amortization deductions over 15years,
    (iii)sufficient taxable income to utilize the amortization
    deductions, and (iv)a 40% effective tax rate. The Internal
    Revenue Service (the IRS) or state or local tax
    authorities might challenge the anticipated tax
    characterizations or related valuations, and any successful
    challenge could materially adversely affect the Companys
    tax profile (including its ability to recognize the intended tax
    benefits from the Transactions), significantly increase the
    Companys future cash tax payments and significantly reduce
    the Companys future earnings and cash flow.

    In the normal course of business, TWC enters into
    multiple-element transactions where the Company is
    simultaneously both a customer and a vendor with the same
    counterparty. For example, when negotiating the terms of
    programming purchase contracts with cable networks, TWC may at
    the same time negotiate for the sale of advertising to the same
    cable network. Arrangements, although negotiated
    contemporaneously, may be documented in one or more contracts.
    In accounting for such arrangements, the Company looks to the
    guidance contained in the following authoritative literature:

    The Companys policy for accounting for each transaction
    negotiated contemporaneously is to record each element of the
    transaction based on the respective estimated fair values of the
    products or services purchased and the products or services
    sold. The judgments made in determining fair value in such
    arrangements impact the amount and period in which revenues,
    expenses and net income are recognized over the term of the
    contract. In determining the fair value of the respective
    elements, TWC refers to quoted market prices (where available),
    historical transactions or comparable cash transactions. The
    most frequent transactions of this type that the Company
    encounters involve funds received from its vendors, which the
    Company accounts for in accordance with EITF
    <font style="white-space: nowrap">02-16.</font> The
    Company records cash consideration received from a vendor as a
    reduction in the price of the vendors product unless
    (i)the consideration is for the reimbursement of a
    specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred in which case
    it would record the cash consideration received as a reduction
    in such cost or (ii)the Company is providing an
    identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration in which
    case it recognizes revenue for this element.

    Recognition.</i> Specifically, if the Company enters into sales
    contracts for the sale of multiple products or services, then
    the Company evaluates whether it has objective fair value
    evidence for each deliverable in the transaction. If the Company
    has objective fair value evidence for each deliverable of the
    transaction, then it accounts for each deliverable in the
    transaction separately, based on the relevant revenue
    recognition accounting policies. However, if the Company is
    unable to determine objective fair value for one or more
    undelivered elements of the transaction, the Company recognizes
    revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.
    For example, the Company sells cable, Digital Phone and
    high-speed data services to subscribers in a bundled package at
    a rate lower than if the subscriber purchases each product on an
    individual basis. Subscription revenues received from such
    subscribers are allocated to each product in a pro-rata manner

<i>Contemporaneous purchases and sales.</i>In the
    normal course of business, TWC enters into multiple-element
    transactions where the Company is simultaneously both a customer
    and a vendor with the same counterparty. For example, when

    cable networks, TWC may at the same time negotiate for the sale
    of advertising to the same cable network. Arrangements, although
    negotiated contemporaneously, may be documented in one or more
    contracts. In accounting for such arrangements, the Company
    looks to the guidance contained in the following authoritative

    The Companys policy for accounting for each transaction
    negotiated contemporaneously is to record each element of the
    transaction based on the respective estimated fair values of the
    products or services purchased and the products or services

    In determining the fair value of the respective elements, TWC
    refers to quoted market prices (where available), historical

    in accordance with EITF

    On July31, 2006, TW NY and Comcast completed their

    substantially all of the cable assets of Adelphia (the
    Adelphia Acquisition). At the closing of the
    Adelphia Acquisition, TW NY paid approximately $8.9billion
    in cash, after giving effect to certain purchase price
    adjustments, and shares representing 17.3% of TWCs
    ClassA common stock (16% of TWCs outstanding common
    stock) valued at approximately $5.5billion for the portion
    of the Adelphia assets it acquired. The valuation of
    approximately $5.5billion for the approximately 16%
    interest in TWC as of July31, 2006 was determined by
    management using a discounted cash flow and market comparable
    valuation model. The discounted cash flow valuation model was
    based upon the Companys estimated future cash flows
    derived from its business plan and utilized a discount rate
    consistent with the inherent risk in the business. The 16%
    interest reflects 155,913,430shares of ClassA common
