    Assets acquired in business combinations were recorded on
    Superiors consolidated balance sheets as of the respective
    acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair values at such
    dates. The results of operations of businesses acquired by
    Superior have been included in Superiors consolidated
    statements of income since their respective dates of
    acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated
    fair values of the underlying net assets acquired, including
    other intangible assets was allocated to goodwill. In certain
    circumstances, the allocations are based upon preliminary
    estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, the allocations are
    subject to revision when we receive final information. Revisions
    to the fair values, will be recorded by us as further
    adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

    We perform our goodwill impairment test annually, or more
    frequently, if an event or circumstances would give rise to an
    impairment indicator. These circumstances include, but are not
    limited to, significant adverse changes in the business climate.
    Our goodwill impairment test is performed at the business
    segment levels, technical services and fluid logistics, as they
    represent our reporting units. The impairment test is a two-step
    process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting
    unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, and uses a
    future cash flow analysis based on the estimates and assumptions
    for our long-term business forecast. If the fair value of a
    reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting
    units goodwill is deemed to be not impaired. If the fair
    value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the
    second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
    determine the impairment loss, if any. This second step compares
    the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill
    with the carrying amount of the goodwill, and if the carrying
    amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the
    implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
    recorded for the difference. Any impairment charge would reduce
    earnings.

    Superior performed an assessment of goodwill at
    December31, 2008 and the tests resulted in no indications
    of impairment. However, Superior determined a triggering
    event requiring an interim assessment had occurred at
    June30, 2009 because the oil and gas services industry
    continued to decline and its net book value had been
    substantially in excess of its market capitalization during the
    second quarter of 2009.

    To estimate the fair value of the business segments, Superior
    used a weighted-average approach of two commonly used valuation
    techniques; a discounted cash flow method and a similar
    transaction method. Superiors management assigned a weight
    to the results of each of these methods based on the facts and
    circumstances that are in existence for that testing period.
    During the second quarter of 2009, because of overall economic
    downturn, management assigned more weighting to the discounted
    cash flow method than the similar transaction method. Given the
    continued deterioration of the general economic and oil service
    industry conditions during 2009,
