business as Dun&amp; Bradstreet TSR Ltd. TSR is a leading provider of business information database on Japanese businesses. Under the agreement, each shareholder contributed its existing large customer business into the joint venture and we
have a 60% majority ownership interest. Additionally, we transferred our small customer business in Japan to TSR. The joint venture will begin business operations in fiscal 2008. The results of the joint venture operations will be included in our
2008 financial statements. </font></p></body></html>
