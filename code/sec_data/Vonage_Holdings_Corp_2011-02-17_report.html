definitions as defined in the Amdocs Enterprise Product Catalog. The output of the system is a rated event, which can be distributed to external systems, such as Amdocs Partner Manager, the Data Warehouse, or to the Invoicing system. After
distribution, the event is written to the usage/rated events repository. At the end of the cycle, the accumulation data is extracted to the Invoicing system. </font></td></tr></table><tr>
