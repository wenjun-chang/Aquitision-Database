When pursing
strategic acquisitions, we will look for businesses that will enable us to capture new customers, new service offerings, new capabilities, new contract vehicles, and/or expand market share. We look to take advantage of these acquisitions by
leveraging these new service offerings to historical NCI customers, as well as offering historical NCI capabilities to our newly acquired customers. </font></p><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">During 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of TRS Consulting, Inc.

Acquisitions </b><p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>TRS Acquisition </b></font></p><p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Effective July31, 2009, the Company completed the
acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of TRS Consulting, Inc. (TRS). TRS is a provider of high-end IT and software development services to the intelligence community. NCI acquired TRS to expand NCIs presence in Intelligence Community.
The Company paid approximately $17.1 million in cash at closing. In addition, the purchase agreement for the acquisition of TRS provided for contingent consideration. </font></p><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">During the third quarter of 2009, we recognized a contingent liability of $5.3 million as part of the TRS acquisition associated with future earnout payments. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we and the
previous majority shareholder of TRS entered into negotiations to terminate the contingent consideration earnout for an immediate cash payment. The rationale for terminating the earnout was based primarily on the operational issues around
maintaining detailed financial information to monitor the earnout, and the business impact due to the inability to leverage TRS resources into other NCI business areas without negatively affecting the achievement of the earnout targets, and the
attractive discount on the potential liability to settle the earnout early. The earnout potential was $6 million and had a fair value of $5.3 million which was recorded as a liability at the time of the TRS acquisition. Both parties determined it
was in the best interest of the combined entity to eliminate the earnout and the parties mutually agreed to the $3 million settlement, 50% of the potential earnout payment. Consequently, we recognized a $2.3 million gain on the extinguishment of
contingent consideration liability. </font></p></body></html>
