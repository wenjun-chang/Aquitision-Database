<html><body><b>Business Combinations and Noncontrolling Interests: </b><i>Business Combinations</i><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">In 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.160, <i>Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin No.51</i> (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity (as opposed to as a liability) and provides guidance on the accounting for
transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. SFAS 160 applies prospectively for us as of July1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We
do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p></body></html>
