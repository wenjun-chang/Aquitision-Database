Accounting Research Bulletin No.51</i> (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity (as opposed to as a liability) and provides guidance on the accounting for
transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. SFAS 160 applies prospectively for us as of July1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We
do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p><i>Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of

2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-4, <i>Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly </i>(FSP FAS
157-4).FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS 157, when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased when compared with normal market
activity for the asset or liability.The new approach is designed to address whether a market is inactive, and if so whether a market should be considered distressed.The objective of the FSP FAS 157-4 is to remain consistent with the
principles of SFAS 157, yet provide additional guidance on how fair value measurements might be determined in an inactive market.FSP 157-4 also requires additional disclosures relating to an entitys valuation techniques and its major
categories of investments in debt and equity securities.FSP 157-4 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June15, 2009.Early adoption is permitted.FSP FAS 157-4 is effective for us beginning
July1, 2009.We do not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 157-4 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </font></p>
