<i>TexStar</i> On August15, 2006, the
    Partnership acquired all the outstanding equity of TexStar by
    issuing 5,173,189 ClassB common units valued at
    $119,183,000, a cash payment of $62,074,000 and the assumption
    of $167,652,000 of TexStars outstanding bank debt. Because
    the TexStar Acquisition is a transaction between commonly
    controlled entities, the Partnership accounted for the TexStar
    Acquisition in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. As a
    result, the historical financial statements of the Partnership
    and TexStar have been combined to reflect the historical
    operations, financial position and cash flows from the date
    common control began (December1, 2004)forward.
