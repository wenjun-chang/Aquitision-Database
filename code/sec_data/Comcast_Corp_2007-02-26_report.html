<b>The Adelphia
Acquisition </b><p align="justify" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">We paid approximately $3.6 billion in cash for the acquisition of Adelphias interest in two cable system partnerships and
certain Adelphia cable systems and to satisfy certain related liabilities. Approximately $2.3 billion of the amount paid was related to the acquisition of Adelphias interest in Century  TCI California Communications, L.P.
(Century) and Parnassos Communications, L.P. (Parnassos and together with Century, the Partnerships). We held a 25% interest in Century and a 33.33% interest in Parnassos. Our prior interests in the Partnerships
were accounted for as cost method investments. After acquiring Adelphias interests in the Partnerships, we transferred the cable systems held by the Partnerships to TWC in the Exchanges, as discussed further below. </font></p><p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">In addition to acquiring Adelphias interest in Century and Parnassos, we acquired cable systems from Adelphia for approximately $600 million in cash that we
continue to own and operate. </font></p><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font color="#35bf85" face="ARIAL" size="2"><b>The Redemptions </b></font></p><p align="justify" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">Our 4.7% interest in TWE was redeemed in exchange for 100% of the equity interests in a subsidiary of TWE holding cable systems </font></p><p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"></font></p><div style="position:relative;float:right; width:48%;padding-right:9px;padding-bottom:4px;overflow:hidden"> <p align="justify" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">with a fair value of approximately $600 million and

Our ownership interests in TWE and TWC were accounted for as cost method investments. </font></p> <p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">We recognized a gain of approximately $535 million, in the
aggregate, on the Redemptions, which is included in investment income (loss), net. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font color="#35bf85" face="ARIAL" size="2">The Exchanges </font></p> <p align="justify" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">The estimated fair value of the cable systems we transferred to and received from TWC was approximately $8.6 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. TWC made net
cash payments aggregating approximately $67 million to us for certain preliminary adjustments related to the Exchanges. </font></p> <p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">The cable systems we
transferred to TWC included our previously owned cable systems located in Los Angeles, Cleveland and Dallas (Comcast Exchange Systems) and the cable systems held by Century and Parnassos. The operating results of the Comcast Exchange
Systems are reported as discontinued operations for all periods and are presented in accordance with SFAS No.144 (see Discontinued Operations below). </font></p> <p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">As a result of the Exchanges, we recognized a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of $195 million, net of tax of $541 million and a gain on the sale of the Century and Parnassos cable systems of approximately $111
million that is included within investment income (loss), net. </font></p> <p align="justify" style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">The cable systems that TWC transferred to us in the Exchanges included cable systems

<p align="justify" style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="ARIAL" size="2">The cable systems acquired in the Adelphia and Time Warner transactions were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.141, Business
Combinations (SFAS No.141). The results of operations for the acquired cable systems have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date (July 31, 2006) and are reported in our Cable
segment. As a result of the redemption of our investment in TWC and the exchange of the cable systems held by Century and Parnassos, we reversed deferred tax liabilities of approximately $760 million, primarily related to the excess of tax basis of
the assets acquired over the tax basis of the assets exchanged and reduced the amount of goodwill and other noncurrent assets that would have otherwise been recorded in the acquisition. Substantially all of the goodwill recorded is expected to be
amortizable for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to refinement as valuations are finalized. The weighted-average amortization period of the franchise-related customer relationship intangible assets acquired was
seven years. </font></p></div>
