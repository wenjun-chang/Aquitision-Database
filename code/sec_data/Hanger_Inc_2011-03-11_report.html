<html><body><b> Acquisitions  </b><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">In 2010, we acquired five O&amp;P companies, operating a total of six patient care centers located in California, New York, Texas, and
Utah. The aggregate purchase price for these O&amp;P businesses was $10.6million, and the expenses incurred by us were insignificant and are included in other operating expenses in the period
incurred. During the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of ACP for a purchase price of approximately $157.8million, and we incurred approximately $5.4million of related
expenses in connection with the acquisition. In 2009, we acquired seven O&amp;P companies and one fabrication facility, operating a total of 23 patient care centers, located in California, Iowa, Nebraska,
New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington. The aggregate purchase price for these O&amp;P businesses was $16.6million. </font></p><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2"><b> Competition  </b></font></p><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">The O&amp;P services industry is highly fragmented, consisting mainly of local O&amp;P patient-care centers. The business of
providing O&amp;P patient care services is highly competitive in the markets in which we operate. We compete with numerous small independent O&amp;P providers for referrals from physicians, therapists,
employers, HMOs, PPOs, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, out-patient clinics and insurance companies on both a local and regional basis. We compete with other patient care service
providers, including device manufacturers that have independent sales forces, on the basis of quality and timeliness of patient care, location of patient-care centers and pricing for
services. </font></p><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">We
also compete with independent O&amp;P providers for the retention and recruitment of qualified practitioners. In certain markets, the demand for practitioners exceeds the supply of
qualified personnel. </font></p><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">Our
therapeutic solutions businesses compete with other providers of equipment and services on a regional and national basis that have similar sales forces and products. We strive to
differentiate our products with additional services such as clinical protocols and continuing education. </font></p><br/><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br/><b> NOTE FACQUISITIONS  </b><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">
On December1, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of ACP for approximately $157.8million in cash and incurred $5.4million of costs to complete the
transaction. These costs, which are reflected as acquisition expenses on the consolidated financial statements, are comprised of $3.3million in legal and advisor fees and $2.1million
in stock based compensation related to the sale of stock to executives
of ACP. The Company recorded: (i)approximately $96.1million of goodwill, which is not amortizable for tax purposes; (ii)$48.2million of intangible assets;
(iii)$32.5million of fixed assets at fair value; (iv)$7.2million of current assets; (v)$6.0million of current liabilities; and
(vi)$20.0million of deferred tax liabilities related to the ACP transaction. The value of the goodwill from this acquisition can be attributed to a number of business factors
including, but not limited to, expected revenue and cash flow growth in future years and our ability to provide patient care services to a previously underserved market. The Company identified
intangible assets totaling $48.2million comprised of; (i)$22.3million of customer relationships with a useful life of 14years; (ii)$9.1million related
to the trade name which has an indefinite life; (iii)$8.1million related to proprietary treatment programs with a useful life of 15years; (iv)$5.4million of
patented technology with a useful life of eight years; and (v)$3.3million related to other assets with a three to five year useful life. The results of operations for ACP are included
in the Company's results of operations from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results would not be materially different. </font></p><p align="CENTER" style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">F-21</font></p><hr noshade=""/><a name="page_fu48601_1_22"> </a><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2"><a href="#bg48601a_main_toc">Table of Contents</a></font></p><p align="CENTER" style="font-family:times;"><font size="2"><b><br/>

addition to ACP, the Company acquired five O&amp;P companies, operating a total of six patient care centers located in California, New York, Texas, and Utah. The aggregate purchase price
for these O&amp;P businesses was $10.6million. Of this aggregate purchase price, $3.0million consisted of promissory notes and $2.2million is made up of contingent considerations
payable within the next three years. Contingent consideration is reported as other liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company recorded approximately $9.2million of
goodwill related to these acquisitions and the expenses incurred to acquire these acquisitions were insignificant and are included in other operating expenses. The results of operations for these
acquisitions are included in the Company's results of operations from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results would not be materially different. Based upon the allocation of the purchase price, the
goodwill related to the acquisitions is not amortizable for tax purposes. </font></p><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">During
2009 and 2008, the Company acquired seven and 13 orthotic and prosthetic companies and related businesses, respectively. The aggregate purchase price, excluding potential
contingent consideration provisions, for 2009 acquisitions was $16.6million, consisting of $10.9million in cash, $3.0million in promissory notes, and $2.7million in
contingent consideration. The aggregate purchase
price for 2008 acquisitions was $13.5million, consisting of $9.6million in cash, and $3.7million in promissory notes, and $0.2million in contingent consideration. </font></p><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">In
connection with contingent consideration agreements with acquisitions completed prior to adoption of the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations becoming effective,
the Company made payments of $1.3million, $1.5million, and $1.1million during the years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The Company has accounted
for these amounts as additional purchase price, resulting in an increase in goodwill. The Company estimates that it may pay up to a total $6.4million related to contingent consideration
provisions of acquisitions in future periods. Of the $6.4million, $4.4million is related to acquisitions completed after adoption of the revised authoritative guidance. </font></p><br/><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br/><b> NOTE FACQUISITIONS (Continued) </b><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">ACP
