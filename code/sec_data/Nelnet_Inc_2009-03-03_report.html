<div align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><b>Variable rate </b><b><i>floor income, net of settlements on derivatives</i></b><b>: </b>Loans that reset annually on July 1
can generate excess spread income compared with the rate based on the special allowance payment
formula in declining interest rate environments. The Company refers to this additional income as
variable rate floor income. The Company excludes variable rate floor income, net of settlements
paid on derivatives used to hedge student loan assets earning variable rate floor income, from its
base net income since the timing and amount of variable rate floor income (if any) is uncertain, it
has been eliminated by legislation for all loans originated on and after April1, 2006, and it is
in excess of expected spreads. In addition, because variable rate floor income is subject to the
underlying rate for the subject loans being reset annually on July1, it is a factor beyond the
Companys control which can affect the period-to-period comparability of results of operations.
</div>
<div align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Variable rate floor income was calculated by the Company on a statutory maximum basis. However, as
a result of the disruption in the capital markets beginning in August2007, the full benefit of
variable rate floor income calculated on a statutory maximum basis has not been realized by the
Company due to the widening of the spread between short term interest rate indices and the
Companys actual cost of funds. As a result of the ongoing volatility of interest rates, effective
October1, 2008, the Company changed its calculation of variable rate floor income to better
reflect the economic benefit received by the Company related to this income taking into
consideration the volatility of certain rate indices which offset the value received. For the year
ended December31, 2008, the economic benefit received by the Company related to variable rate
floor income was $25.7million. There was no economic benefit received by the Company related to
variable rate floor income for the three months ended December31, 2008. Variable rate floor
income calculated on a statutory maximum basis for the three months and year ended December31,
2008 was $2.2million and $44.5million, respectively. Beginning October1, 2008, the economic
benefit used by the Company has been used to determine core student loan spread and base net
income.
</div>
<div align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><b><i>Discontinued operations: </i></b>In May2007, the Company sold EDULINX. As a result of this transaction,
the results of operations for EDULINX are reported as discontinued operations for all periods
presented. The Company presents base net income excluding discontinued operations since the
operations and cash flows of EDULINX have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
Company.

</div>
<div align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Student Loan and Guaranty Servicing segment provides for the servicing of the Companys student
loan portfolios and the portfolios of third parties and servicing provided to guaranty agencies.
The servicing and business process outsourcing activities include loan origination activities,
application processing, borrower updates, payment processing, due diligence procedures, and claim
processing. These activities are performed internally for the Companys portfolio in addition to
generating fee revenue when performed for third-party clients. The guaranty servicing, servicing
support, and business process outsourcing activities include providing software and data center
services, borrower and loan updates, default aversion tracking services, claim processing services,
and post-default collection services to guaranty agencies.
</div>
<div align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Loan servicing fees are determined according to individual agreements with customers and are
calculated based on the dollar value of loans, number of loans, or number of borrowers serviced for
each customer. In addition, the Company earns servicing revenue for the origination of loans.
Guaranty servicing fees, generally, are calculated based on the number of loans serviced, volume of loans serviced, or amounts
collected.

certain asset acquisitions. Although the Companys assets, loan portfolios, net interest income,
and fee-based revenues increase through such transactions, a key aspect of each transaction is its
impact on the Companys prospective organic growth and the development of its integrated platform
of services. The acquisitions described below expand the Companys products and services offered to
education and financial institutions and students and families throughout the education and
education finance process. In addition, these acquisitions diversify the Companys asset generation
streams and/or diversify revenue by offering other products and services that are not dependent on
government programs, which reduces the Companys exposure to legislation and political risk. The
Company also expects to reduce costs from these acquisitions through economies of scale and by
integrating certain support services.

average useful life of approximately seven years. The intangible assets that made up this amount
included non-competition agreements of $2.0million (5-year useful life), customer relationships of
$1.6million (10-year useful life), computer software of $0.4million (5-year useful life), and
trade names of $0.2million (3-year useful life). All intangible assets are amortized using a
straight-line amortization method with the exception of customer relationships. The customer
relationships intangible asset is amortized over the period of projected revenues and expenses
(cash flows) attributable to this asset as of the date of acquisition. Because of customer
attrition, the estimated annual cash flows related to customer relationships diminish as time
extends from the date of acquisition. As such, the Company uses an accelerated amortization method
that reflects the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits of this acquired asset is used
by the Company.

Consideration for the purchase of the remaining 20% of FACTS was $5.6million in cash and 238,237
restricted shares of the Companys ClassA common stock valued at $9.9million. The value of the
common shares issued was determined based on the closing market price of the Companys common
shares over the 2-day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and
announced. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the 238,237 shares of ClassA common stock
issued in the acquisition were subject to put option arrangements whereby during the 30-day period
beginning February28, 2010 the holders of such shares could require the Company to repurchase all

$83.95 per share. The value of the put option as of the acquisition of the remaining 20% of the
stock of FACTS was $7.5million and was recorded by the Company as additional purchase price. The
value of the put option was valued by the Company on the date of acquisition using a Black-Scholes
pricing model using the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 5.1percent, volatility
of 34percent, and no dividend yield. The total consideration recorded by the Company for the
remaining 20% of the stock of FACTS was $23.0million, which represents the $5.6million in cash,
the value of the ClassA common stock of $9.9million, and the value of the put option arrangements
of $7.5million.
