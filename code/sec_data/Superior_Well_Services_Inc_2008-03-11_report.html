    Assets acquired in business combinations were recorded on
    Superiors consolidated balance sheets as of the date of
    the respective acquisition dates based upon their estimated fair
    values at such dates. The results of operations of businesses
    acquired by Superior have been included in Superiors
    consolidated statements of income since their respective dates
    of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the
    estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired,
    including other intangible assets was allocated to goodwill. In
    certain circumstances, the allocations are based upon
    preliminary estimates and assumptions. Accordingly, the
    allocations are subject to revision when we receive final
    information. Revisions to the fair values, will be recorded by
    us as further adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

    In accordance with SFASNo.142, no amortization is
    recorded for goodwill and /or intangible assets deemed to have
    indefinite lives for acquisitions completed after June30,
    2001. SFASNo.142 requires that goodwill and
    <font style="white-space: nowrap">non-amortizable</font>
    assets be assessed annually for impairment. Superior completed
    the annual impairment test for 2006 and 2007 and no impairment
    was determined. Superiors intangible assets consist of
    $5.9million of goodwill and $3.2million of customer
    relationships and non-compete agreements that are amortized over
    their estimated useful lives which range from three to five
    years. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and
    2007, Superior recorded amortization expense of $285,000,
    $345,000 and $805,000, respectively. The estimated amortization
    expense for the five succeeding years approximates $916,000,
    $726,000, $726,000, $667,000 and $207,000 for 2008, 2009, 2010,

    Effective January1, 2006, Superior adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R),
    Share-Based Payment (SFAS123R).
    Under this standard, companies are required to account for
    equity-based awards using an approach in which the fair value of
    an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an
    expense over the requisite service period. Compensation expense
    is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest because service
    or performance conditions are not satisfied. The years ended
    December31, 2006 and 2007 includes $1,740,000 and
    $1,961,000 of additional compensation expense, respectively, as
    a result of the adoption of SFAS123R. Superior had no
    stock based compensation prior to 2006.

    The consolidated financial statements include basic
    and diluted per share information. Basic per share
    information is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
    average number of shares outstanding. Diluted per share
    information is calculated by also considering the impact of
    restricted common stock on the weighted average number of shares
    outstanding.

    Although the restricted shares are considered legally issued and
    outstanding under the terms of the restricted stock agreement,
    they are still excluded from the computation of basic earnings
    per share. Once vested, the shares are included in basic
    earnings per share as of the vesting date. Superior includes
    unvested restricted stock with service conditions in the
    calculation of diluted earnings per share using the treasury
    stock method. Assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method
    would include unamortized compensation cost and potential
    windfall tax benefits. If dilutive, the stock is considered
    outstanding as of the grant date for diluted earnings per share
    computation purposes. If anti-dilutive, it would be excluded
    from the diluted earnings per share computation. The restricted
    shares were anti-dilutive for the three and twelve month periods
    ended December31, 2006.
