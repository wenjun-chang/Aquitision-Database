<html><body><b><i>Pursue Strategic Acquisitions</i></b><div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">While we are primarily focused on organic growth, we will look to supplement that growth through
strategic acquisitions. When pursing strategic acquisitions, we will look for businesses that will
enable us to capture new customers, new service offerings, new capabilities, new contract vehicles,
and/or expand market share. We look to take advantage of these acquisitions by leveraging these
new service offerings to historical NCI customers, as well as offering historical NCI capabilities
to our newly acquired customers.

</div><b>TRS Acquisition</b><div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Effective July31, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of
TRS Consulting, Inc. (TRS). TRS is a provider of high-end IT and software development services to
the intelligence community. NCI acquired TRS to expand NCIs presence in Intelligence Community.
The Company paid approximately $17.1million in cash at closing. In addition, the purchase
agreement for the acquisition of TRS provided for contingent consideration.
</div><div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During the third quarter of 2009, we recognized a contingent liability of $5.3million as part of
the TRS acquisition associated with future earnout payments. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we
and the previous majority shareholder of TRS entered into negotiations to terminate the contingent
consideration earnout for an immediate cash payment. The rationale for terminating the earnout was
based primarily on the operational issues around maintaining detailed financial information to
monitor the earnout, and the business impact due to the inability to leverage TRS resources into
other NCI business areas without negatively affecting the achievement of the earnout targets, and
the attractive discount on the potential liability to settle the earnout early. The earnout
potential was $6million and had a fair value of $5.3million, which was recorded as a liability at
the time of the TRS acquisition. Both parties determined it was in the best interest of the
combined entity to eliminate the earnout and the parties mutually agreed to the $3million
settlement, 50% of the potential earnout payment. Consequently, we recognized a $2.3million gain
on the extinguishment of contingent consideration liability during the year ended December31,
2009.
