The
property is a 200,000 square foot building which is 100% net leased to Philips Holding USAInc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Philips Electronics, through December 2021. The property was
acquired for a purchase price of $50,250, excluding closing costs, and financed with a $41,000, 10-year, fixed-rate first mortgage loan. </font></p><p style="font-family:times;"><font size="2">On
March31, 2006, following the conversion of the entity that owns 200 Franklin Square Drive into a Delaware statutory trust, or DST, we sold approximately 29.3% of our security

received total cash consideration of $12,800 for these interests and the buyer assumed 75% of the DST's underlying mortgage debt. The disposition resulted in a net gain of $4,530, after transaction
costs. As a result of the disposition, this investment is now classified as an investment in joint venture and accounted for using the equity method. As of December31, 2007, the investment has
