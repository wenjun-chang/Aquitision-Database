provisions issued by the FASB within ASC 810-10-65, Consolidation, relating to the presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests (formerly minority interests). The new guidance requires reporting entities to present
noncontrolling (minority) interests as a component of equity (as opposed to as a liability) and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. In addition, the new provisions also require
companies to report a consolidated net income (loss) measure that includes the amount attributable to such noncontrolling interests. The adoption of the new provisions applies to noncontrolling interests prospectively from that date. However, the
presentation and disclosure requirements were applied retrospectively for all periods presented. As a result of this adoption, we reclassified noncontrolling interests in the amount of $0.8 million from liabilities to equity in the June30,
2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet and we included $5.2 million, $0.8 million and $(0.4) million from our noncontrolling interest within the net income (loss) attributable to Harman International Industries, Incorporated in our Consolidated Statement
of Operations for the years ended June30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. </font></p>
