June30, 2010, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. The sale price was subject to a working capital adjustment of $0.1 million, which is also included in the gain. The results of operations for
the QNX Entities have been reclassified to discontinued operations in all periods presented.

principles in the United States (GAAP), have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. The estimates affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1<i>
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</i>, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item8 of Part II of this report. However, we believe the following policies merit discussion due to their higher degree of
judgment, estimation, or complexity. </font></p><i>
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</i><p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Revenue Recognition </i></b></font></p><p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">Revenue is generally recognized at the time of product shipment or delivery, depending on when the passage of title to goods transfers to
unaffiliated customers, when all of the following have occurred: a firm sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Sales are reported net of estimated returns, discounts, rebates and
incentives. Substantially all of our revenue transactions involve the delivery of a physical product. Royalty income, which is not material, is recorded when earned based upon contract terms with licensees which provide for royalties. </font></p><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We enter into incentive agreements with certain automotive customers which relate to a specific program award. These incentives are
generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue where an identifiable benefit can be ascertained. These incentives are generally based on fixed payments paid to us by the automotive manufacturer, and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are
met. The deferability criteria include the existence of legally enforceable rights, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred
amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the related program award term based on our estimate of future volumes. Our estimates are reviewed regularly and the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such
revisions become probable and estimable. </font></p><br /><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br /><b>Business Combinations: </b><i>Acquisition </i><p style="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b>Noncontrolling Interests:</b> On July1, 2009, we adopted the updated
provisions issued by the FASB within ASC 810-10-65, Consolidation, relating to the presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests (formerly minority interests). The new guidance requires reporting entities to present
noncontrolling (minority) interests as a component of equity (as opposed to as a liability) and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. In addition, the new provisions also require
companies to report a consolidated net income (loss) measure that includes the amount attributable to such noncontrolling interests. The adoption of the new provisions applies to noncontrolling interests prospectively from that date. However, the
presentation and disclosure requirements were applied retrospectively for all periods presented. As a result of this adoption, we reclassified noncontrolling interests in the amount of $0.8 million from liabilities to equity in the June30,
2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet and we included $5.2 million, $0.8 million and $(0.4) million from our noncontrolling interest within the net income (loss) attributable to Harman International Industries, Incorporated in our Consolidated Statement
of Operations for the years ended June30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. </font></p><br /><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br /><b><i>Note
