Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 108, Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements. The transition provisions of SAB 108 permit
the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect on retained earnings of
immaterial errors relating to prior years. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment
of any prior quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption
for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next
presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the
SEC to be amended. The Company adopted SAB 108 at the end of fiscal 2006. In
accordance with SAB 108, the Company adjusted beginning retained earnings for
fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the items
described below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to
prior periods.</font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"></font></p><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-style:italic;">Review of Equity Grants and
