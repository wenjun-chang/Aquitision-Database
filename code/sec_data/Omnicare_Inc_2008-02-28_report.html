<html><body><b>Note 2  Acquisitions</b><p><font size="2">Since 1989, the Company has been involved in a program
to acquire providers of pharmaceutical products and related pharmacy management
services and medical supplies to long-term care facilities and their residents.
The Companys strategy has included the acquisition of freestanding
institutional pharmacy businesses as well as other assets, generally
insignificant in size, which have been combined with existing pharmacy
operations to augment their internal growth. From time-to-time the Company may
acquire other businesses, such as pharmacy consulting companies, specialty
pharmacy companies, medical supply and service companies, hospice pharmacy
companies and companies providing distribution and product support services for
specialty pharmaceuticals, as well as contract research organizations, which
complement the Companys core businesses. </font></p><p><font size="2">During 2007, the Company completed 20 acquisitions
(all of which were in the Pharmacy Services segment) of businesses, none of
which were, individually or in the aggregate, significant to the Company.
Acquisitions of businesses required cash payments of approximately $151 million
(including amounts payable pursuant to acquisition agreements relating to
pre-2007 acquisitions) in 2007. During 2006, the Company completed 17
acquisitions (all of which were in the Pharmacy Services segment) of
businesses, none of which were individually significant to the Company.
Acquisitions of businesses required cash payments of approximately $94 million
(including amounts payable pursuant to acquisition agreements relating to
pre-2006 acquisitions) in 2006. During 2005, the Company completed 18
acquisitions (all of which were in the Pharmacy Services segment) of
businesses. Acquisitions of businesses required cash payments of approximately
$2.6 billion (including amounts payable pursuant to acquisition agreements
relating to pre-2005 acquisitions) in 2005. The impact of these aggregate
acquisitions on the Companys overall goodwill balance has been reflected in
the disclosures at the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets note. Omnicare
engages an independent valuation firm to assist with the identification and
valuation of other identifiable intangible assets in connection with the
purchase price allocation of certain acquisitions. The Company continues to
evaluate the tax effects and other pre-acquisition contingencies relating to
certain acquisitions. Omnicare is in the process of completing its allocation
of the purchase price for certain acquisitions, and accordingly, the goodwill
balance is preliminary and subject to change. The</font></p><br/><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br/><b>Acquisitions</b><td valign="BOTTOM">
