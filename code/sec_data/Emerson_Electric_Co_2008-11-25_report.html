      more than 6,000 positions have been eliminated. Based on the current economic

      arise. These actions include relocating facilities to best cost locations and
      geographic expansion to serve local markets. During the past three years,
      approximately 45 production, warehouse or office facilities have been exited
      and
      more than 6,000 positions have been eliminated. Based on the current economic
      conditions, the Company expects rationalization expense, including start-up
      and
      moving, severance and shutdown costs, to be approximately $125 million to $150
      million in 2009.</font></div><br /><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br /><strong>ACQUISITIONS

      rationalization costs of $17 million in 2008 also contributed to the increase
      in
      other deductions, net. Rationalization expense, including amounts reported
      in
      discontinued operations, was $98 million, $83 million and $84 million in 2008,
      2007 and 2006, respectively, or a total of $265 million over the three-year
      period. The Company continuously makes investments in the rationalization of
      operations to improve operational efficiency and remain competitive on a global
      basis, and to position the Company for difficult economic conditions that may
      arise. These actions include relocating facilities to best cost locations and
      geographic expansion to serve local markets. During the past three years,
      approximately 45 production, warehouse or office facilities have been exited
      and
      more than 6,000 positions have been eliminated. Based on the current economic
      conditions, the Company expects rationalization expense, including start-up
      and
      moving, severance and shutdown costs, to be approximately $125 million to $150
      million in 2009.</font></div><br /><hr noshade=""/><hr noshade=""/><br /><strong>(3)

      $561 (net of cash and equivalents acquired of approximately $2) and their

      Brooks, resulting in a pretax gain of $63 ($42 after-tax). The net gain and
      results of operations for fiscal 2008 were classified as discontinued
      operations; prior year results of operations were inconsequential. This business
      was previously included in the Process Management segment. In fiscal 2008,
      the
      Company completed the divestiture of the European appliance motor and pump
      business and received approximately $101 from the sale, resulting in a total
      loss of $92. In connection with a long-term strategy to divest selective
      slower-growth businesses, the Company had been actively pursuing the sale of
      this business. The forecast for this business was lower than originally planned
      due to a slow economic environment for the consumer appliance market, increasing
      competition from Asia, higher commodity costs, and loss of a customer. As a
      result, the carrying value of this business exceeded its estimated realizable
      value, and a loss of $52 was recorded for goodwill impairment in the second
      quarter of 2008. The Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the
      business which resulted in an additional loss of $36 (including goodwill of
      $31)
      during the third quarter of 2008. A $4 loss was recorded when the transaction
      closed in the fourth quarter of 2008. The European appliance motor and pump
      business had total annual sales of $453, $441 and $399 and net earnings,
      excluding the loss, of $7, $7, and $6, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
