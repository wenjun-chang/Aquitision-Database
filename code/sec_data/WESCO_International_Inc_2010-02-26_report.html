<b><i>Pursue Strategic Acquisitions</i></b><div align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><b><i>Drive Operational Excellence via LEAN</i></b>. LEAN continuous improvement is a set of company-wide
strategic initiatives to increase efficiency and effectiveness across the entire business
enterprise, including sales, operations and administrative processes. The basic principles behind
LEAN are to systematically identify and implement improvements through simplification, elimination
of waste and reduction in errors. We apply LEAN in our distribution environment, and develop and
deploy numerous initiatives through the Kaizen approach targeting improvements in sales, margin,
warehouse operations, transportation, purchasing, inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and administrative processes. Our objective is to continue to implement LEAN initiatives across our
business enterprise and to extend LEAN services to our customers.
