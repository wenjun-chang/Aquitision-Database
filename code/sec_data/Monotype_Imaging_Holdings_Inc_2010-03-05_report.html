acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets and liabilities and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over the fair
value of indentified assets is recorded as goodwill. Under ASC 350, goodwill and purchased intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequent, if impairment indicators arise. Purchased
intangibles with definite lives are amortized over their respective useful lives. </font></p><i>Business Combinations</i><p style="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman"><b><i>Revenue Recognition </i></b></font></p><p style="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font size="2" style="font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic No.985,<i> Revenue Recognition </i>(ASC 985).

customers pay us on a periodic basis for the right to embed our text imaging solutions. Though significantly less than royalties from per-unit shipments and fixed fees from OEMs, we also receive
revenue from software application and operating systems vendors who include our text imaging solutions in their products, and for font development. Many of our licenses continue so long as our OEM customers ship products that include our technology,
unless terminated for breach. Other licenses have terms that range from three to five years, and usually provide for automatic or optional renewals. Revenue from per-unit royalties is recognized in the period during which we receive a royalty report
from a customer, typically one quarter after royalty-bearing units are shipped. Revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized when it is billed to the customer, so long as the product has been delivered, the license fee is fixed and
non-refundable and collection is probable. </font></p>
